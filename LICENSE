MODIFICATIONS FROM ORIGINAL DATA
================================================================================

This package processes the original STEPBible TAGNT data as follows:
- Filtered to Textus Receptus (K) readings only
- Properly handles alternate versification markers
- Converted from TSV to JSON format
- Restructured into per-verse files organized by book/chapter
- Standardized word structure with position, text, lemma, morph, strongs fields
- Polytonic Greek text with diacritics is preserved

Gematria/isopsephy values are NOT pre-computed in the stored data; they are
computed on-demand by the scriptures-core library when accessed.
